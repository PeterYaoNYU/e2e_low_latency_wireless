# Reproducibility Guide
This is the Reproducibility Guide for INFOCOM NG-OPERA Submission ***Achieving End-to-End Low-latency Service Across Wireless and Wireline Networks***

This guide include the following sections:
1. How to [get resources](./get_resources.md) on Powder. 
2. How to [set up the network](./setup_network.md). (Software installation and initiation)
3. How to [configure the network](./conf_network.md). (Slicing, different routes, queue discipline configuration)
4. How to [run an experiment](./experiment_run.md).
5. How to [analyze the experiment data](./result_analysis.md). (Generate the plots given in the paper, and additional plots for end-to-end visibility of network latency)

To reproduce, please follow the guide in order.
